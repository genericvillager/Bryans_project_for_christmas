# VR Fire Spinning Experience

# Assignment Brief
My idea for this assignment is to make a baton that can twirl around and is lit on fire with cool and interesting particle systems. This will then be complimented by using a hair dryer outside of the game to simulate the heat coming off of the fire. It will be an immersive experience for your senses.
